        <p>I grew up in Hubbard, Ohio then moved to State College, PA for a year while attending Penn State. Years later, I joined the Air Force and went to BMT in San Antonio, and then Tech-school in Wichita Falls, and then shortly after moved to Vacaville where I currently reside.</p>

        <h2>Cities I'd like to visit</h2>
        <p>I've always had a thing for Paris. I want to see the Eiffel tower eventually. I think Venice would be really interesting to see in person with how the canals work and all. Finally, I love seeing and hearing about the UK and Mildenhall is the only place I can think of there.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Paris, France</strong></li>
            <li><em>Venice, Italy</em></li>
            <li><strong>Mildenhall, UK</strong></li>
        </ol>
